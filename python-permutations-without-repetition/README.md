# python-permutations-without-repetition
A small python side project

This simple program returns the number of ways a string of characters without repeating elements can be sorted.

Theory:

-> P(x) = x! (Formula of permutations without repetition)

-> Permutation is a mathematical way of sorting ordered sets containing x elements {x, y, z ...} 

-> every element must be unique to avoid repetition (the program will result in an error otherwise)
