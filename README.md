### nettgame tables

a composite project of my example game for the nettgame framework, which is also a part of my Bachelor's thesis.

#### What is provided?

This repository contains the **.fbs** file which was compiled using
the **flatc** program into the Java classes also contained within this repository.

a nettgame client or server, it provides next to no functionality of its own.
